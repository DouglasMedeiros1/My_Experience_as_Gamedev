# Tutorial_Game

In this repository I created a small 2d game with basic mechanics of a game of this genre.

As I had never tried Godot Engine 4 (and to save time) I used most of the game Assets and codes taught in the video: How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial from the Brackeys channel [Link for video](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?si=S-hQibCtQJpPm-Ti).

As I liked the final result, I created this small repository to save it here on Github.

(Sorry for the poor quality, there is a .mp4 video in better quality)
